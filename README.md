Final Project: RaveFinder  

---

**Files Included**  
- `Event.swift`  
- `EventViewModel.swift`  
- All SwiftUI view files (HomeView, EventsListView, FavoritesView, etc.)

---

**What I Made**  
I built a mobile app in **Swift and SwiftUI** called **RaveFinder**. It helps users find EDM events based on their genre (like House, Techno, or Dubstep), view event details, and save favorites.

---

**Main Features**  
- View all upcoming events in a clean, scrollable list  
- Filter events by genre (House, Techno, Dubstep, etc.)  
- Tap on an event to view full details  
- Swipe left and right to move between event details  
- Swipe to favorite or unfavorite an event  
- View a personal list of favorited events

---

**Design Process**
- **Empathize**: Built for young EDM fans who want a quick, simple way to find local raves  
- **Define**: The app helps users browse by genre
- **Ideate**: Created wireframes and user flow to make sure navigation felt smooth  
- **Prototype**: Built the app using SwiftUI, with a dark theme and bold card layout  
- **Evaluate**: App follows iOS guidelines and uses usability principles like clear feedback and touch-friendly design

---

**Challenges**
- Making swipe-to-favorite work alongside navigation  
- Managing swipe gestures for horizontal event browsing  
- Making sure the design looked good across all views  
- Keeping everything organized across multiple files

---

**What I Learned**
- How to structure a SwiftUI app using multiple scenes and reusable components  
- How to use gestures like `.swipeActions` and `TabView` for interaction  
- How to design with iOS Human Interface Guidelines in mind  
- How to create a consistent user experience through theming and layout
